# Go Clean Hexagonal Architecture

Reference guides for building Go REST APIs using Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture principles. These documents serve as starting points when scaffolding new Go projects that need a well-structured, maintainable codebase.

## Guides

### [Project-Based Clean Hexagonal Architecture](project-based-clean-hexagonal-arch.md)

Based on a real-world project architecture that has proven to work well in production. It captures specific, opinionated design decisions that emerged from practical experience. Best suited as a reference when you want a battle-tested structure you can adopt directly.

### [Textbook Clean Hexagonal Architecture (with Choices)](clean-hexagonal-arch-textbook-with-choices.md)

A more textbook-aligned approach to clean and hexagonal architecture. Rather than prescribing a single solution, it presents key design decision points where you choose the approach that best fits your project's needs. Best suited when starting a new project and wanting to make deliberate architectural choices.
