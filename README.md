# Go Clean Hexagonal Architecture

Reference guides for building Go REST APIs using Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture principles. These documents serve as starting points when scaffolding new Go projects that need a well-structured, maintainable codebase.

## Intention & Motivation

Having worked and developed in many different engineering teams, I learned the value of having an agreed architectural guidance across projects, which goes beyond our usual (but essential) Engineering Principles and Practices.
Overall this is the kind of doc I wish more teams had. It's intended to be practical, opinionated where it (hopefully only) needs to be, and flexible where it should be.

This is **by no means a perfect document** without any flaws or room for improvement. It contains learnings from building production code over the years, but will never be complete or finished.
As everything in engineering, make sure you think for yourself. Do not blindly accept my suggestions. What has worked well for me in different projects could be a wrong choice for yours.

I welcome comments and collaboration. Never stop learning.

I've obviously thrown my draft at claude for finishing touches, cleaning up my typos, and improve the overall formatting and style. The content does come from myself, and Claude only did some polishing.

## Guides

### [Project-Based Clean Hexagonal Architecture](project-based-clean-hexagonal-arch.md)

Based on a real-world project architecture that has proven to work well in production. It captures specific, opinionated design decisions that emerged from practical experience. Best suited as a reference when you want a battle-tested structure you can adopt directly.

### [Textbook Clean Hexagonal Architecture (with Choices)](clean-hexagonal-arch-textbook-with-choices.md)

A more textbook-aligned approach to clean and hexagonal architecture. Rather than prescribing a single solution, it presents key design decision points where you choose the approach that best fits your project's needs. Best suited when starting a new project and wanting to make deliberate architectural choices.
